# IonQ and Vanderbilt Quantum Initiative Presents: FLIQ 2025 Challenge - MAX-CUT: Ground State at Minimal Cost

Welcome to a deep dive into quantum optimization with IonQ and Vanderbilt Quantum Initiative! This challenge focuses on tackling the **Maximum Cut (MaxCut)** problem, a well-known NP-hard combinatorial optimization task. Participants will explore and apply mighty **variational Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (varQITE)** algorithm.

## Challenge Overview

The main goal of this challenge is to design optimal ansatz generators and Hamiltonians for the MaxCut problem. Participants are also encouraged to modify the implementation of varQITE and its corresponding hyperparameters, such as the number of iterative steps and the learning rate.

This challenge is designed for individuals with varying levels of familiarity with quantum concepts:

- **For Beginners:** The "Quantum Mischief" notebook provides a basic introduction to the problem and essential concepts to get you started.
- **For Those More Familiar:** The "IonQ VQI FLIQ 2025" notebook offers a more in-depth exploration for students who have a foundational understanding of quantum concepts or have already worked through the "Quantum Mischief" notebook.

## How to Participate and Submit

1. **Registration:**
    
    - Begin by registering your team using the `submit.ipynb` notebook. You will need to provide your team name and then the first name, last name, and email address for each team member.
2. **Experimentation and Development:**
    
    - You can experiment with your solutions and code modifications within the provided notebooks (`IonQ_VQI_FLIQ_2025.ipynb` or `Quantum Mischief.ipynb`).
    - Once you have developed your solution, transfer the code modifications into the `submit.ipynb` notebook.
3. **Submission:**
    
    - Follow the instructions within the `submit.ipynb` notebook to pass your source code to the auto-grader for evaluation.
    - To run your code on a different graph, simply change the `graph_number` variable in the `submit.ipynb` notebook and resubmit. Any currently running job will be automatically stopped, and the leaderboard will be updated with its results up to that point.
    - Execution time can vary significantly depending on your chosen parameters and code. You can interrupt cell execution at any time; however, processing will continue on the servers until complete. Submitting a new run will gracefully end the previous one.

**Good Luck, and Have Fun!**
